    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    cgca
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    module cgca
    9.    
   10.    !  DESCRIPTION
   11.    !    The top level module for CGPACK.
   12.    !  NOTES
   13.    !    The lowest level modules are level 1, e.g. cgca_m1co.
   14.    !    Level 1 modules use no other modules.
   15.    !    Level 2 modules use only level 1 modules.
   16.    !    Level 3 modules use some level 2 modules and possibly
   17.    !    also level 1 modules. And so on. All modules except the
   18.    !    top level, this one, are named
   19.    !     cgca_mX<name>
   20.    !    where X is the level number, starting from 1, and
   21.    !    name is the module name.
   22.    !
   23.    !    The modules group routines dealing with a particular
   24.    !    data structure or a problem, e.g. cgca_m3clvg deals
   25.    !    with cleavage propagation, cgca_m2gb deals with
   26.    !    the grain connectivity array.
