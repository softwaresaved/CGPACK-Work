   76.    !  SIDE EFFECTS
   77.    !    A single binary file is created using MPI/IO
   78.    !    with contents of coarray.
   79.    !  DESCRIPTION
   80.    !    Parallel Stream Write Coarray of Integers:
   81.    !    - coarray - what array to dump
   82.    !    - stype - what cell state type to dump
   83.    !    - fname - what file name to use
   84.    !  NOTES
   85.    !    All images must call this routine!
   86.    !
   87.    !    MPI must be initialised prior to calling this routine,
   88.    !    most probably in the main program.
   89.    !    Likewise MPI must be terminated only when no further MPI
   90.    !    routines can be called. This will most likely be in the
   91.    !    main program. 
   92.    !    There are some assumptions about the shape of the passed array.
   93.    !
   94.    !    The default integer is assumed for the array at present! 
   95.    !  USES
   96.    !    cgca_m1co, MPI library
