   48.    !  DESCRIPTION
   49.    !    This routine does grain volume calculation.
   50.    !    For each cell (i,j,k) in coarray, the routine increments
   51.    !    gv(coarray(i,j,k)).
   52.    !  NOTES
   53.    !    All images must call this routine!
   54.    !
   55.    !    There are several SYNC ALL barriers, because all images must
   56.    !    get the updated gv array.
   57.    !    It is possible (probable?) that there's too much syncronisation,
   58.    !    leading to poor performance.
   59.    !    This should be investigated at depth.

  311.    !  DESCRIPTION
  312.    !    This routine analyses the fracture layer of the coarray, i.e.
  313.    !    coarray( : , : , : , cgca_state_type_frac).
  314.    !    It calculates the number (volume) of failed (fractured)
  315.    !    cells. Cells of states cgca_frac_states are considered failed.
  316.    !  NOTES
  317.    !    This routine can be called by and and all images.
