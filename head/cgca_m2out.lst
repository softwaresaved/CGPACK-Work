  165.    !    Parallel Cray output routine. This routine works only on Cray
  166.    !    systems using non-standandard proprietary Cray extension, beware!
  167.    !    Refer to Cray "Enhanced I/O: Using the assign Environment",
  168.    !    section 13 of Cray Fortran Reference Manual, S-3901-83, June 2014

  171.    !
  172.    !    First Cray assign enviroment is established, setting fname
  173.    !    for shared IO access. Then image 1 writes the last record in
  174.    !    the file. After that all images know the length of the file.
  175.    !    Then all images can write their data in the correct place in
  176.    !    this file in parallel. The expectation is that this is faster
  177.    !    than a serial writer, cgca_swci.
  178.    !
  179.    !    All images must call this routine!

  286.    !    Comma Separated Values of Integers.
  287.    !    All images call this routine.

  290.    !  WARNINGS
  291.    !    DO NOT USE!!!!
  292.    !    This subroutine is not very useful, and therefore
  293.    !    the work on it stopped.
  294.    !    In fact it might not work at all.
  295.    !    So for now it is just a dummy.
  296.    !    If you want to use it, do so on your own risk.
  297.    !    In fact it is not even accessible from outside of the enclosing module.
  298.    !    It might be removed in future version with no notice!
