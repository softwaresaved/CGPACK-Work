   43.    
   44.    !  INPUTS

   50.    
   51.    !  SIDE EFFECTS
   52.    !    State of coarray changed
   53.    !  DESCRIPTION
   54.    !    This routine randomly scatters the given number of grain
   55.    !    nuclei over the model. The grain nuclei are assigned unique
   56.    !    numbers starting from zero.
   57.    !
   58.    !    All elements of the coarray must be in cgca_liquid_state state.
   59.    !    If not, the program will stop with a error.
   60.    !
   61.    !    The number of nuclei must not greater than "critfract" of
   62.    !    the model size. I arbitrarily set this to 0.1 for now.
   63.    !    However, even this is too high. Although, in principle
   64.    !    each cell can be a nuclei, such model would have no physical
   65.    !    sense.
   66.    !
   67.    !    Inputs:
   68.    !    - coarray - the model
   69.    !    - number - number of nuclei to scatter
   70.    !    - debug - if .true. dump some debug output
   71.    !  NOTES
   72.    !    All images must call this routine!
   73.    !    However, the work will be done only by image 1.
   74.    !    There's "sync all" at the end of this routine.
