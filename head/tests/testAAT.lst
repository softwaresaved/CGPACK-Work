    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testAAT
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: cgca_dacf, cgca_hxi, cgca_hxg
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    Checking deactivation of crack flanks with halo exchange.
   14.    !    In image1 fracture coarray only, cells on one plane are given
   15.    !    "crack edge" values. Then cgca_dacf is called. As all interior cells
   16.    !    on this planes are switched to "crack flanks".
