    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testABY
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABY
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Testing routines from the linked list module, cgca_m2lnklst.
   12.    !  NOTE
   13.    !    All routines are serial, so no need to use multiple images.
   14.    !    A single image will do.
   15.    !  DESCRIPTION
   16.    !    Verify data integrity and compare timings of
   17.    !    cgca_swci and cgca_pc - i.e. a serial writer from image 1
   18.    !    and a parallel direct access shared writer. The latter is
   19.    !    a non standard Cray extension. So don't try to run this
   20.    !    on non-Cray machines.
