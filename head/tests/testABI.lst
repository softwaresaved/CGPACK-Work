    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testABI
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABI
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Timing cgca_sld2
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    Timing solidification where the check for the complete
   14.    !    solidification of the whole model is done with a divide and
   15.    !    conquer algorithm, cgca_redall, which does a collective AND
   16.    !    reduction over a logical array.
   17.    !  NOTE
   18.    !    This is timing test only. Use testABH to check the correctness of
   19.    !    cgca_sld2.
