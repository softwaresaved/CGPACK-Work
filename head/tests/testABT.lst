    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testABT
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABT
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: cgca_gdim, cgca_cadim
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    cgca_gdim finds the optimum coarray grid layout for a
   14.    !    given total number of images. It also reports the
   15.    !    quality of this optimum, from 0 - worst, to 1 - best.
   16.    !    cgca_cadim then calculates the coarray dimensions
   17.    !    the new updated box size.
   18.    !  NOTE
   19.    !    Both cgca_gdim and cgca_cadim are serial routines.
   20.    !    It makes no sence to run this test at high numbers of images.
   21.    !    A single image is enough to test the routines.
