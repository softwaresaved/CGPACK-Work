    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testABO
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABO
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: cgca_clvgp, cgca_clvgsd, cgca_pswci, cgca_sld3
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    Checking cleavage propagation across grain boundary
   14.    !    with many grains. Still a single cleavage nucleus.
   15.    !    Put it at the centre of one of the faces of the model.
   16.    !    Solidification is done with Cray reduction, CO_SUM (cgca_sld3).
   17.    !    Output is done with MPI/IO (cgca_pswci) and with
   18.    !    the serial version (cgca_swci). The timings of both
   19.    !    IO routines are done for comparison.
