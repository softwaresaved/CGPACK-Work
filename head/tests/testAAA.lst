    6.    !  SYNOPSIS

    8.    program testAAA
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: getcodim, cgca_as, cgca_ds 
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    Testing allocating and deallocating a coarray and reading 2
   14.    !    codimensions from command line. The program must be called
   15.    !    with 2 command line arguments, both positive integers. These are
   16.    !    codimensions along 1 and 2. The number of images must be
   17.    !    such that
   18.    !    codimension3 = num_images()/( codimension1 * codimension3 )
   19.    !    is a positive integer.
