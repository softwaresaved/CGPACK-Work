    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testABA
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABA
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: cgca_clvgp (no CO_SUM version) , cgca_m2gb, cgca_clvgsd
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    Checking cleavage propagation across grain boundary
   14.    !    with two grains, i.e. a single grain boundary.
   15.    !  NOTE
   16.    !    With no grain boundary smoothing, crack
   17.    !    finds it very hard to propagate across a grain boundary.
   18.    !    This is because the GB is locally very irregular, and
   19.    !    it is likely the first cell in the new grain will find
   20.    !    itself in some sort of corner or a tunnel, from where
   21.    !    it cannot see enough neighbours of the same grains
   22.    !    to propagate into. Hence use cgca_gbs, at least once,
   23.    !    possibly multiple iterations.
