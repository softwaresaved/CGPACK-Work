    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: cgca_clvgp (no CO_SUM version), cgca_clvgsp
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    Checking probabilistic cleavage propagation with 1 cleavage nucleus
   14.    !    in the middle of image 1. Single grain with  random rotation tensor.
   15.    !    1-2 cleavage increments. Halo exchange, so cleavage propagation
   16.    !    across image boundary. Check crack flank deactivation.
