    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testABU
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABU
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: cgca_imco
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    First need to call cgca_gdim, cgca_cadim to
   14.    !    calculate all parameters of coarray space.
   15.    !  NOTE
   16.    !    cgca_gdim and cgca_cadim can be called by any or all images.
   17.    !    Their results do not depend on the index of the invoking image.
   18.    !    However, cgca_imco must be called by every image,
   19.    !    So it makes sense to call all three routines by every image.
