    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testABJ
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABJ
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Testing and timing dumping the local coarray from each image into
   12.    !    its own local binary stream file.
   13.    !  DESCRIPTION
   14.    !    Some postprocessing program (not written yet) should be used to
   15.    !    check the integrity of the resulting files, e.g. by reading them
   16.    !    all and writing all data into a single file for analysis with
   17.    !    Paraview.
   18.    !
   19.    !    The timing of this test should be compared against a test using
   20.    !    cgca_swci.
