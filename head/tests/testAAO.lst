    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testAAO
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Timing cgca_sld
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    cgca_sld is the first attempt of solidification. It uses SYNC ALL
   14.    !    a lot. It is simple, but probably not efficient.
   15.    !  NOTE
   16.    !    This is timing test only. Use other tests to check the correctness
   17.    !    of cgca_sld.
