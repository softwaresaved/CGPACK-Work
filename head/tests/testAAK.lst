    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testAAK
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testAAK
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: cgca_sld, cgca_nr, cgca_irs, cgca_hxg
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    This program is designed to assess the max coarray dimension,
   14.    !    assuming cubic coarray, and cubic coarray grid.
   15.    !    Run it until it fails to fit in memory.
   16.    !    The array is not written to disk.
   17.    !
   18.    !    Note that, at least on Hector, it makes sense to maximise the
   19.    !    number of processors, and run as quickly as possible, rather
   20.    !    then maximise the memory used by each processor. So the purpose
   21.    !    of this test is limited to computers with limited number of
   22.    !    processors, where achieving a big model requires using all
   23.    !    memory.
   24.    !
   25.    !    On the other hand, CGPACK, at present, does not scale well,
   26.    !    so using lots of memory per node and fewer nodes is best
   27.    !    for performance for now.
