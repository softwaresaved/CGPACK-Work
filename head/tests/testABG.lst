    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testABG
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABG
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Timing cgca_sld1
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    cgca_sld1 is the second attempt of solidification. It uses
   14.    !    SYNC IMAGES to enforce the order of a collective operation.
   15.    !    However, like cgca_sld, it still does it one image at a time.
   16.    !    It is more complex to program than cgca_sld, but hopefully
   17.    !    slightly more efficient.
   18.    !  NOTE
   19.    !    This is timing test only. Use other tests to check the correctness
   20.    !    of cgca_sld1.
