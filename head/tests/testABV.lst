    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABV
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Cleavage propagation in a model with the given "box" size,
   12.    !    mean grain size and the microstructure resolution values.
   13.    !    Using MPI I/O here!
   14.    !  DESCRIPTION
   15.    !    First need to call cgca_gdim, cgca_cadim to
   16.    !    calculate all parameters of coarray space, including
   17.    !    the number of nuclei. Then call solidification and then
   18.    !    cleavage.
