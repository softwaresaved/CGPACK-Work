    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testABX
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABX
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Testing Cray parallel direct access file IO, aka "assign"
   12.    !    environment, routine cgca_m2out/cgca_pc.
   13.    !  NOTE
   14.    !    Compile only on Cray! Don't try to compile with other compilers!
   15.    !  DESCRIPTION
   16.    !    Verify data integrity and compare timings of
   17.    !    cgca_swci and cgca_pc - i.e. a serial writer from image 1
   18.    !    and a parallel direct access shared writer. The latter is
   19.    !    a non standard Cray extension. So don't try to run this
   20.    !    on non-Cray machines.
