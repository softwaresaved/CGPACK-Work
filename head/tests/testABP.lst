    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testABP
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABP
    9.          
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: cgca_tchk
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    Checking the MAXMIN value of the dot product between
   14.    !    an arbitrary cleavage plane normal and all 26 unit vectors
   15.    !    connecting the central cell with its neighbours.
   16.    !    cgca_tchk is a serial routine, so can make only image 1 call it,
   17.    !    or even better, make all images execute it, to increase the
   18.    !    search space. No sync required.
