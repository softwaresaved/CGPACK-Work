    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testAAB
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testAAB
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: cgca_as, cgca_ds, cgca_swci
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    Writing all coarrays to a file in order, as if it were a single
   14.    !    large 3D array (super array).
   15.    !
   16.    !    Reading 2 codimensions from command line.
   17.    !    The program must be called
   18.    !    with 2 command line arguments, both positive integers. These are
   19.    !    codimensions along 1 and 2. The number of images must be
   20.    !    such that
   21.    !    codimension3 = num_images()/( codimension1 * codimension3 )
   22.    !    is a positive integer.
