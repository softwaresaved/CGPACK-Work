   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: cgca_clvgp (no CO_SUM version), cgca_clvgsp 
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    Checking probabilistic cleavage propagation with 1 cleavage nucleus 
   14.    !    in the middle of image 1. Single grain with random orientation.
   15.    !    Multiple cleavage increments. Halo exchange, so cleavage propagation 
   16.    !    across image boundary. Check crack flank deactivation.
   17.    !    Check formation of multiple cleavage planes.
