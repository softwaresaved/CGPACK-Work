    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testABW
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testABW
    9.    
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Check cgca_clvgp_nocosum (no CO_SUM version).
   12.    !    Cleavage propagation in a model with the given "box" size,
   13.    !    mean grain size and the microstructure resolution values.
   14.    !    Using parallel I/O here!
   15.    !  DESCRIPTION
   16.    !    First need to call cgca_gdim, cgca_cadim to
   17.    !    calculate all parameters of coarray space, including
   18.    !    the number of nuclei. Then call solidification and then
   19.    !    cleavage.
   20.    !  NOTE
   21.    !    Using 2 cleavage nuclei to see how the two macro-cracks interact.
