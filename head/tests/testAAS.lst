    4.    !  NAME
    5.    !    testAAS
    6.    !  SYNOPSIS
    7.    
    8.    program testAAS
    9.          
   10.    !  PURPOSE
   11.    !    Checking: cgca_dacf
   12.    !  DESCRIPTION
   13.    !    Checking deactivation of crack flanks.
   14.    !    Note that in this test we need to use at least 2 state types
   15.    !    in the space coarray.
   16.    !
   17.    !    In image1 coarray only, cells on one plane are given "crack edge"
   18.    !    values. Then cgca_dacf is called. As all interior cells on this planes
   19.    !    are switched to "crack flanks".
