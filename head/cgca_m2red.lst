   47.    logical(kind=ldef),intent(inout) :: coarray[*]
   48.    integer(kind=idef),intent(in) :: p
   49.    
   50.    !  SIDE EFFECTS
   51.    !    coarray values change
   52.    !  DESCRIPTION
   53.    ! This routine does collective AND operation over coarray values across
   54.    ! all images. The result is returned in coarray on every image.
   55.    ! The result is TRUE
   56.    ! if coarray values on all images are TRUE, and FALSE otherwise.
   57.    ! The algorithm implements a divide and conquer scheme that works
   58.    ! only when the number of images, n, is a power of 2 - n=2**p.
   59.    ! p is the input to this routine.
   60.    !
   61.    ! If the number of images is 2**p,
   62.    ! then reduction takes p iterations.
   63.    ! In this example I have 2**4=16, so it takes 4 iterations.
   64.    !
